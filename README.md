To use, first add .env files in root and /client. These files require info from Oauth application setup on your Github account.
Use yarn to install dependencies within root and /client directories.

For development, type 'npm run dev'

For production, First run 'npm run build' within /client, then run 'npm start' from root.

To deploy to Heroku: create and checkout a deploy branch, build client app after setting proper env variables, remove build directory from .gitignore so files included in commit, and then push this branch to heroku master.
